# 🏭 Autonomous Software Factory Workflow

> \[!NOTE\] This is an **Executable Document**. It not only describes the workflow but also serves as the real-time monitoring interface for the factory.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture: Decoupling & Orchestration

The factory is composed of five specialized autonomous components orchestrated by a central brain.

### 🔍 視覺化地圖
由於產線流程較為複雜，我已將「完整決策藍圖」移至獨立頁面以獲得最佳顯示效果。

## 📊 Live Factory Status (Experimental)

This section demonstrates the Power of Quarto: reading the actual `.jules/tracker.json` (if it exists) to show real-time progress.

::: callout-tip
### How it works

The following block uses Python to parse the project state and render a progress summary directly into this document.
:::

``` python
import json
import os

tracker_path = ".jules/tracker.json"
if os.path.exists(tracker_path):
    with open(tracker_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    print(f"**Current Phase:** {data.get('current_phase', 'N/A')}")
    # Additional logic to render progress bars can go here
else:
    print("> ⚠️ No active tracker found. Factory is currently idle.")
```

## 🛠️ Role Definitions

### 1. [Factory Orchestrator](../skills/factory-orchestrator/SKILL.md)

The central navigator. Manages state transitions and input/output flow between components.

### 2. [Requirements Analyst](../skills/requirements-analyst/SKILL.md)

Specializes in intent classification (`Create`, `Continue`, `Maintain`) and baseline requirement gathering.

### 3. [Visual Designer](../skills/visual-designer/SKILL.md)

**Optional.** Activated only for UI-heavy payloads. Generates Design Tokens and Layout specs.

### 4. [Architect Reviewer](../skills/architect-reviewer/SKILL.md)

Handles ADR generation and defensive simulation.

### 5. [Factory Iterator](../skills/factory-iterator/SKILL.md)

Generates the `tracker.json` and micro-task specs for workers.

> \[!TIP\] **Literate Strategy**: By using `.qmd`, we ensure that the documentation evolves with the code. If a new skill is added, it must be registered in this blueprint to be visible to the Orchestrator. :::: :::::
